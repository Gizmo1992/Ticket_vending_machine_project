# Ticket_vending_machine_project
It's a ticket vending machine which generates tickets for the users accordingly to which service they are needed. It is like the ones in larger pharmacies which sells.
I made this program because it was a challenge in one of my Udemy classes (Total Python: Become an advenced Python developer in 16 days). I managed to solve the challenge without checking the solutions. 
I made this in order to practice installing packages and getting familiar with decorators and generators. This program tracks the previously assigned numbers for each branches and gives out the next number correctly with the right letter code.
